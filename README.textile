h1. formtotal

This is a simple javascript class that will add up input fields 
with a class of @addend@ in a form and place the running total
in an input field with an ID of @total@ and ensure that field is
disabled.

Each time the @total@ field is updated, a cookie is set in the
browser to maintain the total value.  Any form field with the ID
of @total@ will be prepopulated with the value of this cookie.
